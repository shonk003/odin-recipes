    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    Main Ingredients
    <ul>
        <li>150 grams pancetta cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 small onion finely diced</li>
        <li>Â¾ cups chopped pistachios unsalted</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream (or 35% cooking cream)</li>
        <li>500 grams pasta penne, rigatoni or other of your choice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. grated Parmigiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chopped pistachios in a dry pan and toast them until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than the suggested cooking time. Reserve some of the cooking water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a skillet large enough to hold the pasta, on medium high heat. Add the cubed pancetta and cook, stirring, until it has rendered it's fat and is crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer the pancetta to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the diced onion to the pan. Cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in about 1/2 of the crushed pistachios and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Pour in the cooking cream and cook on medium heat for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and add to the skillet. Stir in the reserved pancetta and toss to coat the pasta in the cream sauce.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp. of grated cheese to create a creamier consistency. If the sauce is too thick, add a ladle or two of pasta water to thin it as necessary</li>
        <li>Serve immediately garnished with the remaining chopped pistachios and extra grated cheese at the table.</li>
    </ol>
