    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    Main Ingredients
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. sweet or hot Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, 3 thinly sliced, 2 finely grated</li>
        <li>½ tsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>1 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more</li>
        <li>1 5-oz. package baby spinach, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 15.5-oz. cans white beans, rinsed</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 12" crusty Italian sub roll, cut in half crosswise, split lengthwise, or 2 ciabatta rolls, split lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 oz. Parmesan or Pecorino, finely grated</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley (for serving; optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or high-sided skillet over medium-high. Add sausage and press down on it with a heatproof rubber spatula to flatten slightly. Cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 4 minutes. Turn sausage over and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes. Break up sausage into bite-size pieces with spatula. Add sliced garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook, stirring, until garlic is beginning to get golden around the edges, about 1 minute. Carefully add tomatoes (beware of splatter!), then 2½ tsp. salt and 1 cup water. Bring sauce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, 10–12 minutes. Mix in spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add beans and cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Taste ragù and season with more salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat broiler. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Mix in grated garlic and remaining ½ tsp. salt and cook until fragrant and sizzling but garlic is not yet browned, about 30 seconds; remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Arrange bread, cut side down, on a foil-lined baking sheet and broil until golden brown, about 1 minute. Remove from broiler and turn bread over. Brush untoasted sides of bread with garlic butter and broil until evenly golden brown on top, about 1 minute (keep watch; it will go fast).</li>
        <li>Divide toast among plates. Ladle a generous amount of ragù over and top with Parmesan and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
